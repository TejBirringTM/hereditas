# Principia

(Our Principles)

## Our Purpose

Hereditas was founded on the principle that precise genealogical documentation should be accessible to all. Through our unique Codex Notation system, we unite mathematical rigor with historical preservation, enabling accurate and enduring family trees. Our current approach minimises digital infrastructure requirements, allowing family histories to be shared widely and preserved across generations with unmatched fidelity.

## Our Foundation

At the intersection of computer science and genealogy, Hereditas emerged from a recognition that complex family relationships deserve a standardised, precise method of documentation. While traditional family tree software sacrificed accuracy for simplicity, we envisioned a system that could capture the true intricacy of familial connections without compromise, and without profiteering.

## Our Values

- **Precision:** Our Codex Notation ensures mathematical accuracy in recording family relationships, capturing complex lineages with clarity and confidence

- **Accessibility:** Free access, ensuring genealogical documentation remains open to all who seek to preserve their family's history

- **Preservation:** Encoded sharing links safeguard family trees with minimal digital infrastructure, ensuring histories remain accessible across technological changes

- **Community:** A gathering place where genealogists, academics, and family historians unite to document and share their discoveries

- **Innovation:** Merging timeless record-keeping principles with modern technology to create an enduring platform for family history

## Our Vision

To establish the definitive (open-source) platform for precise genealogical documentation, where every family's history is preserved with mathematical accuracy and remains accessible through an elegant interface that makes complexity feel natural. We envision a future where intricate family relationships can be explored, understood, and shared across generations with unprecedented ease and precision.

# Principia

## Our Purpose

Hereditas was founded on the principle that precise genealogical documentation should be accessible to all. Through our unique codex notation system, we unite mathematical rigor with historical preservation, enabling accurate and enduring family trees. Our approach minimises digital infrastructure requirements, allowing family histories to be shared widely and preserved across generations with unmatched fidelity.

## Our Foundation

At the intersection of computer science and genealogy, Hereditas emerged from a recognition that complex family relationships deserve a standardised, precise method of documentation. While traditional family tree software sacrificed accuracy for simplicity, we envisioned a system that could capture the true intricacy of familial connections without compromise.
